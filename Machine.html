                  <p>Pascal is a major character in Nier: Automata, and is a machine who has developed a sense of empathy and compassion towards both machines and androids. Initially, Pascal is encountered as the leader of a group of machines living in a peaceful village, where he strives to maintain a peaceful coexistence between machines and androids.</p>
                  <p>Despite being a machine, Pascal possesses a deep understanding of emotions and morality. He is kind and gentle towards others, and is always willing to lend a helping hand. Pascal also serves as a mentor to the younger machines in his village, teaching them about the world and instilling in them a sense of kindness and compassion.</p>
                  <p>However, as the story of Nier: Automata unfolds, Pascal is forced to confront the harsh realities of the world. His peaceful village is destroyed, and he is faced with the brutality of the machines who have become corrupted by their desire for power. Pascal is forced to make difficult decisions, and must confront the reality of the world he lives in.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the game, Pascal serves as a symbol of hope and compassion in a world that is often dark and violent. His kindness and empathy towards others is a reminder that even in the face of adversity, it is possible to maintain one's humanity. Pascal's story also serves as a commentary on the nature of violence and conflict, and the importance of empathy and understanding in promoting peace and coexistence.</p>

                <p>Machine Spear is a weapon that is featured in the action role-playing video game, Nier: Automata. It is a type of spear that is wielded by the machine enemies in the game. The Machine Spear is a powerful weapon that can deal significant damage to the player character.</p>
                <p>In terms of its design, the Machine Spear is a long metal rod with a sharp point at one end. It is a simple but effective weapon that is used by the machine enemies to great effect in combat. The spear can be thrust forward to impale the player character or swung in a wide arc to hit multiple targets at once.</p>
                <p>The Machine Spear is one of the many weapons that the player character, 2B, can acquire throughout the game. By defeating machine enemies and looting their corpses, the player can collect Machine Spears and use them to upgrade their own weapons or sell them for in-game currency.</p>
                <p>While the Machine Spear is a formidable weapon, it is not without its weaknesses. Its long reach can make it difficult for enemies to close in for close-range attacks, but it is also slower to wield than some other weapons in the game. Additionally, the spear is vulnerable to parrying and counterattacks, which can leave the wielder exposed to enemy attacks.</p>
