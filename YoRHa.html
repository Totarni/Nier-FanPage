                  <p>2B is one of the main protagonists in Nier: Automata. She is an android created by humans to fight against the machines that have taken over the Earth. She is a combat model, which means she is designed to be an exceptional fighter with incredible speed, strength, and agility. She wears a black outfit with a white skirt and has a blindfold covering her eyes, which serves as a reminder of her mission.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the game, 2B is accompanied by 9S, another android who provides support during missions. 2B is stoic and professional, but she also has a caring and compassionate side, which she often hides behind her cold exterior. As the game progresses, 2B starts to question her mission and the true nature of the war between the machines and androids. She is also haunted by memories of her past and the loss of her previous partner.</p>
                  <p>2B is a skilled fighter who excels in close combat with her sword. She can also hack into machines, which allows her to take control of them or destroy them from the inside. She has access to a variety of other weapons and abilities, which can be upgraded throughout the game. In addition to combat, 2B also performs reconnaissance missions and has a deep understanding of the machines' behavior and psychology.</p>
                  <p>Overall, 2B is a complex and intriguing character in Nier: Automata. Her journey through the game is filled with emotional highs and lows, as she struggles to come to terms with her identity and purpose. She is a powerful fighter and a loyal friend, but she also has vulnerabilities and weaknesses that make her relatable and human.</p>

              <p>Virtuous Contract is the default weapon of the game's protagonist, 2B. It is a one-handed sword that is lightweight and easy to handle, making it a versatile weapon for close-range combat. The blade itself is made of a durable material that is capable of cutting through even the toughest of enemies.</p>
              <p>In terms of combat capabilities, Virtuous Contract is a reliable weapon that allows 2B to perform quick slashes and combos. It also has a charged attack that can deal heavy damage to enemies, making it a useful tool for taking down stronger opponents. Additionally, Virtuous Contract has a "counter" ability, which allows 2B to parry incoming attacks and immediately counter-attack with a powerful strike.</p>
              <p>Virtuous Contract is also significant to the game's story, as it represents the relationship between 2B and her partner, 9S. The weapon's name is a reference to a promise made between the two characters, symbolizing their commitment to their mission and each other. As the game progresses, Virtuous Contract becomes a reminder of the bond between 2B and 9S, and serves as a tangible connection to their shared experiences.</p>
