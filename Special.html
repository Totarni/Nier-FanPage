                  <p><i>Emil</i> is a young boy who wears a white hooded robe. He is initially encountered by the game's main protagonists, androids <i>2B</i> and <i>9S</i>, while wandering alone in a desolate area of the game world. <i>Emil</i> is revealed to be a genetically engineered human with powerful magical abilities, including the ability to petrify enemies with his gaze.</p>
                  <p><i>Emil</i> is a tragic figure, having been forced to become a living weapon by a shadowy organization known as the Project Gestalt. He is the only survivor of the project, which was intended to create superhuman soldiers to combat a deadly alien invasion. <i>Emil</i>'s incredible power also comes with a terrible price: his body is slowly deteriorating, and his mind is haunted by the guilt of the atrocities he was forced to commit.</p>
                  <p>Despite his tragic past and physical limitations, <i>Emil</i> is a loyal ally to <i>2B</i> and <i>9S</i>, helping them in their quest to defeat the alien invaders and uncover the truth behind the world they inhabit. <i>Emil</i>'s role in the story becomes increasingly important as the game progresses, and his ultimate fate is one of the game's most poignant moments.</p>

                <aside>
                  In NieR Automata, we encounter Emil in a completely different form, as he has rebuilt himself. However, the similarity is that his head remained the same.

                <p><i>Emil</i> Heads are small, robotic versions of <i>Emil</i>'s head that can be found hidden throughout the game's world. They are often tucked away in hard-to-reach locations or hidden behind obstacles, and can be easy to miss if players are not paying close attention.</p>
                <p>Collecting <i>Emil</i> Heads is not necessary to complete the game, but it does unlock a special side quest that explores <i>Emil</i>'s backstory in more detail. As players collect more <i>Emil</i> Heads, they will unlock new entries in a special in-game encyclopedia that sheds light on <i>Emil</i>'s past and his connection to the game's larger narrative.</p>
                <p>While <i>Emil</i> Heads may seem like a lighthearted collectible at first glance, they actually play an important role in the game's story. As players progress through the game, they will learn more about <i>Emil</i>'s tragic past and the terrible experiments that were performed on him. The <i>Emil</i> Heads serve as a reminder of <i>Emil</i>'s humanity and his struggles, and collecting them can be a way for players to show their support for the character.</p>
