	<p>The video starts with the text "Square Enix presents" then it changes to „developed by PlatinumGames Inc.”, which then disappears in a bright glow.</p>
	<p><i>Music: The choir is singing while an action music is playing alongside it.</i></p>
	<p>Next, we see a battle scene in a forested area between a female character who is wielding a sword and jumping around, and slaying robots.</p>
	<p>Then we switch to the inside of a factory where the female character kicks a robot, which explodes into a red/purple light, and then she quickly takes out another robot.</p>
	<p>There is another scene change where we are back in the forested area, the camera is rotating around the female character who is standing next to a floating robot companion, with the sun shining in the background.</p>
